eLua write once file system
---------------------------
*(v0.9 and above)* The WOFS (Write Once File System) is a read-write file system designed
to use the MCU's internal flash as storage. It has an important limitation: a file can be 
written only once, in a single shot (although there is a mechanism to "overwrite" a file
that has already been written, see below for details). After the file is written, it is 
not possible to append more data to it or modify its current data. While this limitation 
might seem prohibitive, WOFS can have quite a few practical uses, including:

- receiving files and saving them in the internal flash using the *recv* command in the 
  link:using.html#shell[eLua shell].
- copying a file from another file system in the internal flash using the *cp* command in 
  the link:using.html#shell[eLua shell].
- save the history of the code you typed in the interactive Lua shell if 
  link:linenoise.html[linenoise] is enabled.
- data logging. Generally a data logger always appends to its log file, just like WOFS.

Also, WOFS can be completely reinitialized to a "blank" (empty) state using the *wofmt*
command in the link:using.html#shell[eLua shell].

WOFS has a number of important advantages over a "real" read-write file system:

- very low footprint. WOFS is implemented as a simple extension to the 
  link:arch_romfs.html[ROM file system], using an internal file system representation which
  is very similar to the one ROMFS uses. In fact, both file systems are implement in
  _src/romfs.c_.
- it is flash-friendly. The WOFS internal file system structure is completely linear, thus
  flash sectors are written in natural order from the first free sector to the last sector
  in flash. This eliminates the need for a flash wear leveling layer.
- it keeps data in the internal flash and each file occupies a single contiguous block
  of memory. Since the internal flash is directly accesible by the MCU, this important
  property allows Lua bytecode files in WOFS to take advantage of some eLua memory 
  optimizations (for example the read-only strings and executing bytecode directly from flash)
- it needs very little RAM. In a fully blown read-write
  file system, a flash sector would be split into logical "blocks" used by the files in the
  filesystem. If the sector must be erased, but some blocks inside it still contain useful
  information, the file system implementation would need to copy the block content in RAM,
  erase the sector and write back the useful information in flash from RAM. As some eLua
  targets have flash sectors which are quite large, this operation might fail due to
  insufficient RAM, most likely leaving the file system in an inconsistent state.

Also, the WOFS implementation can logically overwrite a file. For example, you can issue this
command multiple times:

----------------
$ recv /wo/f.lua
----------------

After each execution of the *recv* command, there will be a single _/wo/f.lua_ file, updated
with the latest data received by *recv*. However, the previous "versions" of _/wo/f.lua_
are not actually deleted. Instead, a "file deleted" flag is set on these previous versions,
effectively making them invisible to the rest of the system. They are still physically
in flash though, so they occupy memory just like a regular file. 

Enabling WOFS in eLua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to enable WOFS, you need to tell the implementation how much flash the eLua image uses.
This information can be made available at compile time by exporting a linker command 
file constant named *flash_used_size*. The value of this constant must reflect the 
total size in flash of the eLua image, including the code, constants, data section
and possibly other sections. For an example of how to define this constant, check
_lm3s.ld_ in _src/platfrom/lm3s_.

Another thing that you need to specify is the internal flash structure. The flash memory is divided
into contigous areas called _sectors_ (a _sector_ is the smallest erasable unit in a flash memory). 
The sector organization can vary greatly amongst various MCUs, but eLua provides a generic
mechanism to describe the flash structure:

- if the flash is divided into equally sized sectors, define the *INTERNAL_FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE*
  macro to the size of one flash sector.
- if the flash sectors have different sizes, define the *INTERNAL_FLASH_SECTOR_ARRAY* macro
  as an array that contains the size of each flash sector in turn.

Check your MCU datasheet to find which of the above variants you need to use.

Other macros that you need to define are given in the table below:

[width="90%", cols="<2s,<5", options="header"]
|===================================================================
^|  Option                        ^| Meaning                                    
| INTERNAL_FLASH_SIZE              | The size of the internal flash memory, in bytes
| INTERNAL_FLASH_START_ADDRESS     | The start address of the internal flash memory in the MCU address space
| INTERNAL_FLASH_WRITE_UNIT_SIZE   | The unit size of the Flash write access routine (see below).
|===================================================================

Finally, your platform implementation needs to define two functions for accessing the
internal flash. The first one is a flash write function, called by WOFS to actually write
data in flash. Its signature is in _inc/platform.h_:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
u32 platform_s_flash_write( const void *from, u32 toaddr, u32 size );
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on your platform, the flash write hardware may have different requirements.
Some MCUs only allow writing the flash in multiples of a power of 2 (usually 4), at
an address which is a multiple of a power of 2, or both. If this is the case for your
MCU (check the datasheet), define *INTERNAL_FLASH_WRITE_UNIT_SIZE* to the required
alignment. This way, you can be certain that your _platform_s_flash_write_ function 
will be called only with a destination address (_toaddr_) that is a multiple of 
*INTERNAL_FLASH_WRITE_UNIT_SIZE* and with a size (_size_) that is also a multiple of
*INTERNAL_FLASH_WRITE_UNIT_SIZE*.

The second flash-related function is used to erase pages from flash (used only when "formatting" 
the WOFS image via *wofmt*, as already explained). Its signature is also in _inc/platform.h_:

-------------------------------------------------
int platform_flash_erase_sector( u32 sector_id );
-------------------------------------------------

Check this link TODO for more details about the flash platform interface.
If all the above requirements are met, just define *BUILD_WOFS* in your _platform_conf.h_ file, compile
and burn your eLua image and you'll have a WOFS instance up and running. Check link:building.html[here]
for more details about the configuration of your eLua image.

Using WOFS
~~~~~~~~~~
IMPORTANT: the examples in this section are written in Lua, but the exact same observations apply for 
C code that needs to work with files in WOFS.

The WOFS is mounted under _/wo_, so in order to open a file from WOFS simply
prefix its name with _/wo/_, as in the example below :

--------------------------------
f = io.open( "/wo/f.lua", "wb" )
--------------------------------

Don't forget the fundamental limitation of WOFS: once you open a file in
write mode, you need to write the _whole_ content of a file before calling *f:close()*.
After you close the file, you won't be able to open it in write mode anymore. Also,
if the file is opened in write mode, you'll only be able to write data _at the end_
of the file. You can still use _f:seek_ to read data from any location in the file,
but if you try to write when the file pointer is not positioned at the end of the file
you'll get an error. You can use the append mode to automate this process. If a file
is opened in append mode, its file pointer is automatically positioned at the end
of the file before each write operation. To open a file in append mode, simply use
*a* instead of *w* when opening the file:

--------------------------------
f = io.open( "/wo/f.lua", "ab" )
--------------------------------

The last things that you need to remember: *always close your WOFS file descriptor
when you're done with it*. This is extremely important. If the file is opened in 
read mode, forgetting to close its file descriptor will just leak some memory, which
is a non-fatal error. However, if the file is opened in write mode (this includes
append mode) and you foget to close its file descriptor, the file size will not be
correctly registered in the WOFS internal structure, which will lead to a corrupted
file system. So remember to do this:

---------
f:close()
---------

This isn't actually such a big problem with Lua, since a file is automatically closed 
when the file's userdata is garbage collected, but becomes very important
when using WOFS in C code. 

Notes
~~~~~
Some things you should consider when using the WOFS:

- WOFS shares the same memory that is used to hold the eLua firmware. Although WOFS shouldn't touch the eLua firmware,
  various bugs in the code might render eLua unusable. In this case, simply reflash eLua and everything should be fine.
- there is currently no way to find how much free space exists on WOFS. If you write data to WOFS, always compare the
  length of the data being written with the length reported by the _write_ function (the actual number of bytes written).
  If they are different, this most likely means that there is not enough data left on the internal Flash.
- while in theory it is possible to _sometimes_ keep the WOFS contents after reflashing the eLua firmware, this is a
  manual, error prone procedure that will not be described here. Better keep in mind that after reflashing the eLua firmware 
  your WOFS will also be initialized (empty). So remember to save all the important files in WOFS before reflashing 
  the firmware.
- WOFS is *not* a robust file system. If a power failure happens when a WOFS file is opened in write mode, a file system 
  corruption is almost a certainty. The same holds true in the case of a serious error in the eLua code that triggers
  a non-recoverable CPU exception, or if you simply hit the RESET button on the eLua board by mistake. As a general rule, 
  do not use WOFS to store important data.
