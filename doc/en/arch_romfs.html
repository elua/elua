<h3>The ROM file system</h3>
<p>The ROM file system (ROMFS) is a small, read-only file system built for <b>eLua</b>. It is integrated with the C
  library, so you can use standard POSIX calls (fopen/fread/fwrite...) to access it. It is also accessible directly from Lua via the <b>io</b> module.
  The files in the file system are part of the <b>eLua</b> binary image, thus they can't be modified after the image is
  built. For the same reason, you can't add/delete files after the image is built. ROMFS doesn't support
  sub-directories.</p>
<p>ROMFS is integrated with <a href="building.html">the build system</a> for maximum flexibility on various platforms. As a result, you can select the ROMFS contents for each board on which 
  <b>eLua</b> runs. Moreover, you can specify what <b>applications</b> (instead of individual files) go to the file system, as a real application might need more than a single Lua program 
  to run (for example a HTTP page with all its dependencies).</p>
<h2>Using ROMFS</h2>
<p>To use ROMFS, you have to copy the required files to the <i>romfs/</i> directory, before building eLua.
 Keep in mind that the maximum file name of a ROMFS file is 14 characters, including the dot between the file 
  name and its extension. Make sure that the file names from <i>romfs/</i> follow this rule. Then edit the main build script (<b>SConstruct</b>) to add a new application
  or to modify an existing one.
  All the applications that can be included in ROMFS are defined in the <b>romfs</b> array in <b>SConstruct</b>. Each application in the <b>romfs</b> array lists its files, as shown below 
  (note that <b>ltthpd</b>, <b>tvbgone</b> and <b>pong</b> applications require more than one file in order to run):</p>
<p><pre><code>romfs = { 
    'bisect' : [ 'bisect.lua' ],
    'hangman' : [ 'hangman.lua' ],
    'lhttpd' : [ 'index.pht', 'lhttpd.lua', 'test.lua' ],
    'pong' : [ 'pong.lua', 'LM3S.lua' ],
    'led' : [ 'led.lua' ],
    'piano' : [ 'piano.lua' ],
    'pwmled' : [ 'pwmled.lua' ],
    'tvbgone' : [ 'tvbgone.lua', 'codes.bin' ],
    'hello' : [ 'hello.lua' ],
    'info' : [ 'info.lua' ],
    'morse' : [ 'morse.lua' ],
    'dualpwm' : [ 'dualpwm.lua' ],
    'adcscope' : [ 'adcscope.lua' ],
    'life' : [ 'life.lua' ]
}</code></pre></p>
<p>After this, you need to decide the application-to-board mapping. This is defined in another array in <b>SConsctruct</b>, named <b>file_list</b>. The definition of this array is shown below,
  the format is self-explanatory:</p>
<p><pre><code>file_list = { 
    'SAM7-EX256' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman' , 'led', 'piano', 'hello', 'info', 'morse' ],
    'EK-LM3S8962' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'lhttpd', 'pong', 'led', 'piano', 'pwmled', 'tvbgone', 'hello', 'info', 'morse', 'adcscope' ],
    'EK-LM3S6965' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'lhttpd', 'pong', 'led', 'piano', 'pwmled', 'tvbgone', 'hello', 'info', 'morse', 'adcscope' ],
    'STR9-COMSTICK' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'led', 'hello', 'info' ],
    'PC' : [ 'bisect', 'hello', 'info', 'life' ],
    'LPC-H2888' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'led', 'hello', 'info' ],
    'MOD711' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'led', 'hello', 'info', 'dualpwm' ],
    'STM3210E-EVAL' : [ 'bisect', 'hello', 'info' ],
    'ATEVK1100' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'led', 'hello', 'info' ],
    'ET-STM32' : [ 'hello', 'hangman', 'info', 'bisect' ],
    'EAGLE-100' : [ 'bisect', 'hangman', 'lhttpd', 'led', 'hello', 'info' ]              
}
</code></pre></p>
<p>What's left to do is <a href="building.html">build eLua</a>. As part of the build process, <b>mkfs.py</b> will be called, which will read the contents of the <i>romfs/</i> directory and 
  output a C header file that contains a binary description of the file system. To use ROMFS from C code, whevener you want to access a file, prefix its name with <b>/rom/</b>. For example, 
  if you want to open the <b>a.txt</b> file in ROMFS, you should call fopen like this:</p>
<p><pre><code>f = fopen( "/rom/a.txt", "rb" )</code></pre></p>
<p>If you want to execute one file from the ROM file system with Lua, simply do this from the shell:</p>
 <p><pre><code>eLua# lua /rom/bisect.lua</code></pre></p>
<p>Or directly from Lua:</p>
 <p><pre><code>&gt; dofile "/rom/bisect.lua"</code></pre></p>
<a name="mode" /><h2>ROMFS modes</h2>
<p>Starting with version 0.7, the ROMFS can be added to the <b>eLua</b> binary image in 3 different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>verbatim</b>: this is the default option. All the files are copied to the ROMFS directly, without any processing.</li>
  <li><b>compress</b>: compress the Lua source code by using <a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/luasrcdiet/">LuaSrcDiet</a> (included in <b>eLua</b>), a program
  that can decrease the size of a Lua source file by applying different transformations. Every
  Lua source file (extension <b>.lua</b>) from ROMFS is fed through LuaSrcDiet and the result is written in the <b>eLua</b> binary image. This option can yield
  pretty good compression, the only downside being that the compressed Lua source files aren't generally easily readable. However, this isn't really a problem in
  most practical cases.</li>
  <li><b>compile</b>: precompile the Lua source code to bytecode. Every Lua source file (extension <b>.lua</b>) from ROMFS is fed through the Lua cross compiler
  (see <a href="using.html#cross">here</a> for details on cross compilation and its benefits) and the result is written in the <b>eLua</b> binary image. This option
  might decrease or increase the physical size of the ROMFS image, but its real benefits are increased speed (because <b>eLua</b> doesn't need to compile the Lua
  code to bytecode first) and decreased RAM consumption (the Lua parser might get quite memory-hungry at times, which in turn might lead to stack overflows and very
  hard to find bugs). <b>NOTE</b>: this option is not available if eLua is compiled in 64-bit integer only mode (lualonglong).</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="building.html#buildoptions">here</a> for instructions on how to specify the ROMFS compilation mode.</p>
