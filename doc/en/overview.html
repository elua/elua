<a name="whatis" /><h3>What is eLua?</h3>
<p><strong>eLua</strong>
stands for <strong>Embedded Lua</strong> and the project
aims to offer the full set of features of the <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua Programming Language</a> to the embedded world. </p>

<p><strong>eLua</strong>
is not a stripped down set of Lua; much on the contrary, it strives to
offer the same features as the desktop version of Lua, but complementing them with 
specific features for embedded use.
Besides offering different flavors of the full Lua implementation
(like the possibility of choosing between an integer-only and a floating
point numbers implementation),
a lot of work was and will be done in the direction of making Lua
more "embedded-friendly" by augmenting the core language with features
that allow lower memory requirements.</p>

<p>Lua is the perfect example of a
minimal, yet fully
functional language. Although generally advertised as a "scripting
language" (and used accordingly especially in the game industry), it is
also fully capable of running stand-alone programs. (ex: Adobe Lightroom, World of Warcraft,
...). Its limited
resource requirements make it suitable to a lot of microcontroller
families. The intrinsic high portability of the original Lua code
(which is ANSI C and runs virtually on every platform for which an ANSI
C compiler is available) combined with the highly portable software
architecture of <b>eLua</b> allow for easy porting of the project to a large variety or architectures. The peripheral access libraries exported by <b>eLua</b> are also portable by design, so one could run a Lua program (without or with very few modifications) on every <span style="font-weight: bold;">eLua</span> supported platform (the <a href="status.html">project status &amp; roadmap</a> shows a constantly growing list of platforms on which <b>eLua</b> is supported). <b>eLua</b> inherits the minimalistic and functional design of Lua, staying in line with the well known <b>KISS</b>, <i>Keep It Small and Simple</i> philosophy.</p>

<p>The aim of the project is to have a fully functional Lua development
environment <strong>on the microcontroller itself</strong>,
without the need to install a specific development environment on
the PC side, other than a serial or ehternet console/terminal emulator.</p>
<p>We can't end this short presentation without presenting our project motto: No matter what you do with <b>eLua</b>, always remember to have
Fun with it :)</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="features"></a><h3>Features</h3>
<p>As already stated, <b>eLua</b> allows you to run Lua completely on
the
target microcontroller. A fast-growing set of complementary modules is also
provided, for programming <strong>eLua</strong> microcontroller's peripherals. </p>
<p>The following important features are ready or being implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a flexible, configurable build system.</li>
  <li>access to the Lua interpreter on the target MCU via a variety of physical transports (RS-232 being the most popular).</li>
  <li>a (mostly) platform independent peripheral library (PIO,
  UART, PWM, SPI, TMR, ADC, NET, I2C...)</li>
  <li>a very low footprint embedded ROM file system, easy to port to different types of memory chips and other storage devices</li>
  <li>a small FAT R/W file system layer for SD cards</li>
  <li>a minimal "shell" (for file operations, environment configuration and other facilities)</li>
  <li>network support</li>
  <li>an embedded http server</li>
  <li>Terminal / Console over Ethernet</li>
  <li>debugging (directly on the MCU or remotely with the PC).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the functionality (implemented and planned) in <strong>eLua</strong> check <a href="status.html">the status page</a>.</p>
<p>Porting <strong>eLua</strong> to another compatible platform should be as easy
and
painless as possible. Currently this is restricted to platforms for
which the gcc+newlib combo is available. This restriction will disappear in the near future, as <b>eLua</b> will have its own libc and thus it will be available on a much
broader range of MCUs.</p>
<p>The Lua implementation comes in two flavors: "regular Lua"
(using
floating point as the number type) and "integer Lua" (using integers).
"Regular Lua" will be able
to perform floating point operations (but will be slower because the
floating point operations will be emulated in software on the MCU),
while "integer Lua" will only be able to perform operations with
integer numbers (but support for fixed and even floating point can be
added with separate modules) and thus will be faster.</p>
<br />

<a name="audience"></a><h3>Audience</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">eLua</span> has a wide and varied audience, starting from newcomers to the embedded world who want an
easy and powerful environment for prototyping, rapid application
development and quick production, and ranging towards highly skilled developers
that want to extend their programs with the Lua library facilities and
portable features.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">eLua</span>
allows embedded-oriented programmers to use the simplicity and
power of the Lua programming language and to hide the low-level
complexities and platform/architecture-dependent features. With <b>eLua</b>,
the programmer can focus on the actual implementation of his program,
without having to worry about accessing the low-level peripheral
configuration and data registers, as the platform libraries already
take care of this. This increases productivity and eliminates the often
frustrating task of dealing with platform-specific drivers. </p>
<p>The list below summarizes <b>eLua</b>'s target audience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Embedded developers that are looking for a fast, easy to use and powerful way of coding.</li>
  <li>First-time
embedded programmers (or simply first time programmers) who are
looking for an easy way to "dive" into the embedded programming world.
eLua is a great learning tool.</li>
  <li>People that aren't really
developers, but still want to be able to prototype an embedded system
fast and painless, without having to learn C for that.</li>
  <li>Embedded
developers who need powerful meta-language mechanisms for complex code
algorithms and data description.</li>
  <li>Field
engineers that can go to their customer site and debug an eLua module on
site, without any preparation at all, since the whole development
environment resides on chip already.</li>
</ul>
