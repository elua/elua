<h3>Installing eLua</h3>
<p>After building <b>eLua</b>, you need to install it (flash it to your board of choice) before using it. This section shows specific installation instructions for all the CPU/boards supported by <b>eLua</b>. Make sure that you already have a suitable <b>eLua</b> image for your target (either <a href="downloads.html">dowload one</a> or <a href="building.html">build it yourself</a>), then choose the platform of interest from the "Installing" submenu.</p>
<p>When building your <b>eLua</b> image, remember to specify "prog" to the scons command line in order to get a binary image file that's suitable for programming.</p>
