What is eLua?
-------------

eLua stands for *Embedded Lua* and the project aims to offer the full
implementation of the http://www.lua.org[Lua Programming Language] to
the embedded world, extending it with
specific features for efficient software embedded development.

[[features]]
General Features
----------------

*eLua* allows you to run Lua completely on the target
microcontroller.

Some aspects of eLua are:

* *Transforms hardware in commodity:* Design and code your products for
  eLua and make them as hardware-independent as possible. Upgrade or
  completely change your hardware in the future and save time and money,
  using the approved source code with little or no modifications.
* *Source code portability:* Like in Lua, you program in C, Lua or a
  mixture of both and your program runs in a wide varied of (sometimes
  radically different) platforms and architectures supported.
  Full control of the platform.: eLua runs on the "bare-metal".  There
  is no Operating System between your programs and the microcontroller.
  Develop on targets: fully functional Lua and a dedicated shell on the
  microcontroller itself. No need to install a specific development
  environment on the PC side, other than a serial or ehternet
  console/terminal emulator. You can also use any text editor, save your
  programs in sd/mmc and other media and use them directly in your
  platforms.
* *Flexible products:* Add modern high level script-language capabilities
  to your projects, resulting in highly adaptable, field-programable and
  reconfigurable designs. Efficient (and cheap!) future evolution to
  your systems.
* *Learn embedded:* Simple interactive and interpreted experimenting
  cycle. Use your desktop programming skills to become an embedded
  systems developer in no time and with a lot of fun.
* *Embedded RAD:* Prototype and experiment on a Rapid Aplication Develop
  model. Test your ideas directly on the target platforms and cheap
  development kits. No need for simulators or future code adaptations.
* *Ready to use kits:* A big (and growing!) number of Open Source hardware
  and commercially available platforms supported. Prototype cheap and
  fast and design your final hardware later using the produced code.
* *Longevity:* Add user configuration and scripting capabilities to your
  projects, making them adaptable to the always changing contexts of
  industrial processes, evolving engineering, automation standards,
  field optimizations etc...
* *Worry-free Licence:* eLua is free and open-source software and we
  promote it as much as we can. But our MIT licence (the same as Lua's)
  allows you to use eLua in your commercial and private-code products as
  well. Nothing to ask, no royalties to pay, just tell the world you're
  using eLua.

[[audience]]
Audience
--------

*eLua* has a wide and varied audience, starting from newcomers to the embedded
world who want an easy and powerful environment for prototyping, rapid
application development and quick production, and ranging towards highly
skilled developers that want to extend their programs with the high-level
Lua libraries and portable features.

*eLua* allows embedded-oriented programmers to use the simplicity and power of
the Lua programming language and to hide the low-level complexities and
platform/architecture-dependent features. With eLua, the programmer can
focus on the actual implementation of his program, without having to worry
about accessing the low-level peripheral configuration and data registers,
as the platform libraries already take care of this. This increases
productivity and eliminates the often frustrating task of dealing with
platform-specific drivers.

The list below summarizes eLua's target audience:

* Embedded developers that are looking for a fast, easy to use and
  powerful way of coding.

* First-time embedded programmers (or simply first time programmers)
  who are looking for an easy way to "dive" into the embedded
  programming world. eLua is a great learning tool.

* People that aren't really developers, but still want to be able to
  prototype an embedded system fast and painless, without having to
  learn C for that.  Embedded developers who need powerful
  meta-language mechanisms for complex code algorithms and data
  description.

* Field engineers that can go to their customer site and debug an eLua
  module on site, without any preparation at all, since the whole
  development environment resides on chip already.

* Final clients and decision makers, who benefits from the fact that
  eLua portability transforms hardware into comodities. In systems
  using eLua, replacing field sensor and actuator controllers by
  diferent models, brands and architectures have no impact on the main
  application software.

Current Status
--------------
The project is very active and the worldwide distributed collaboration has 
been growing steadly. Manufacturers, user's companies and other organizations also
starting to collaborate and support the project.

The current official version is *eLua v0.8* and we have released 9 versions
since the project was published.

Supported platforms and features include a wide range of microcontroller
families and architectures. A list of currently supported platforms, peripherals and features can be
seen in our link:status.html[Status page]

Authors
-------

eLua is a joint project of link:overview.html#contacts[Bogdan Marinescu], a
software developer from Bucharest, Romania and
link:overview.html#contacts[Dado Sutter], head of the Led Lab at PUC-Rio
University, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Its origins come from the
http://www.circuitcellar.com/renesas2005m16c/winners/1685.htm[ReVaLuaTe]
project, also developed by Bogdan Marinescu (as a contest entry for
the 2005 Renesas M16C Design Contest), and the Volta Project, managed
by Dado Sutter at PUC-Rio from 2005 to 2007.

eLua is developed in an fully open, distributed and colaborative
model. An always growing list of collaborators from all over the
planet can be found in our link:comunity.html#credits[Credits Page].
