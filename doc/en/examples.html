<h3>Lua Code Examples</h3>
<p><b>eLua</b> distros come bundled with nice and fun
(yes! we have games too! :) Lua programs examples in the File System. They are also included in the <b>eLua</b>
source code distribution, under the <i>/romfs</i> subdirectory. As previously explained, you can run them directly from <b>eLua</b>'s file
system or you can use the eLua shell and send them via XMODEM, as
described <a href="using.html#shell">here</a>.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>hello.lua: the ubiquitous "Hello, World!"</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>all targets</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>to call this a "program" is a gross overstatement, but it's a
tradition, so we respect it :) It just prints "Hello, World!" on the terminal and
returns to the shell. Run it from the file system only if you feel too lazy to fire up
the lua interpreter inside eLua and write it yourself :)</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>info.lua: getting the platform data</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>all targets</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>this isn't really more advanced than "Hello, World!", but it does show
an <b>eLua</b> specific module: the platform data module (<b>pd</b>). You can read
more about the platform modules <a href="">##here</a>. The program will display the platform
name, the CPU name, the board name and the CPU clock and then will exit
to the shell.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>led.lua: the old LED blinker, the new eLua way</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong> all targets except i386</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong> now we get to do something "more embedded": blink a LED. The code illustrates a few interesting <b>eLua</b> features:</p>
<ul><li><b>cross platform code</b>: the code assigns a different pin
to the LED starting from the board name. You can see how the platform
data module makes it very easy to write such portable code.</li>
<li><b>uart, pio, tmr, pd modules</b>: they are all used here.</li></ul>
<p>Watch it blink, then press any key to return to the eLua shell.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>hangman.lua: taking advantage of your terminal</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>all targets</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>the geekiest example from the <b>eLua</b> distribution (or would it be morse.lua? :), it makes use of
the <a href="">##term module</a> to let the user play a BSD-like "hangman" directly in his terminal emulator. Run the example
and enjoy. Currently it has a very small list of words, as this was
written mainly as a proof of eLua's capabilities, but it's very easy to
add new words/replace the existing ones. A screenshot can be seen <a href="">##here</a>.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>pwmled.lua: LED blinker, advanced class</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>EK-LM3S8962, EK-LM3S6965</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>this uses the PWM module to fade the on-board LED in and out, in an
infinite loop. Not much to say here, the code is very simple, yet the
results are quite spectacular. Press any key to end the sample and
return to the shell.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>dualpwm.lua: because a single LED is just not enough</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>MOD711</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>My <a href="http://www.sctec.com.br/content/view/101/30/">MOD711 board</a> needed a
"motherboard" for a few components (mainly the RS232-TTL level converter and a reset button) so I also added two LEDs to it, connected
to two different PWM channels. With this program, the two LEDs fade at the same type, but in different directions.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>pong.lua: eLua meets a classic</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>EK-LM3S8962, EK-LM3S6965</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>a very simple, incomplete implementation of the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">pong</a>
game. It uses the display and keys on the EK-LM3S8962 or EK-LM3S6965 boards. It uses a platform dependent module (<b>disp</b>) and also shows how
<b>require</b> can be used from <b>eLua</b>.You can set different game speeds. Enjoy! :)</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>tvbgone.lua: yes, eLua can do real time!</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>EK-LM3S8962, EK-LM3S6965</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>this is more complex, but also very important for <b>eLua</b>, because it
proves that real time applications (with relatively strict timing
requirements) can run from <b>eLua</b> directly. It's the famous TV-B-Gone
project adapted from <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/tvbgone/">LadyAda's kit</a>.
If you're not familiar with TV-B-Gone, it knows how to do one thing
very well: power off your TV :) Basically it contains a lot of remote
control codes (for a lot of TVs) that are continously sent via an IR
LED. This code uses the PWM module (new in <b>eLua</b> 0.4) and it also does
file I/O from Lua, since the remote control codes are kept in a
separate file (which is also part of the ROM file system). To read the
binary file, the "pack" module (also new in 0.4) is used. To ensure
that we don't get any unexpected delays, the Lua garbage collector is
turned off. Take a look at this sample, it's both a very good proof of
the capabilities of eLua and a good learning resource.<br>
To use it on EK-LM3S8962 or EK-LM3S6965 connect an IR LED
with a resistor between the "PWM2" and "GND" pins of the extension
connector. Get close to your TV and press the "select" button on your
board to start sending the IR codes. The on-board LED stays lit while
the codes are transmitted and shuts off afterwards. Press the "down"
button on your board to exit the application and return to the shell.</p>

<h3>piano.lua: because PWM is great</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>EK-LM3S8962, EK-LM3S6965, SAM7-EX256</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>yet another use for the PWM module, this sample can be used to "play"
notes via the on-board speaker using the PC keyboard. The on-screen
keyboard shows what keys you must press for different notes, and you
can set your octave and inter-note delay. Press ESC to end your <b>eLua</b>
musical session :) A screenshot can be seen <a href="##">here</a>.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>bisect.lua: floating point at its best</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>all targets</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>this is taken directly from the official Lua distribution, and it's
here to show that <b>eLua</b> can do floating point just like on a desktop
machine, albeit slower. Run it on your target, then run it again, but
this time on the PC, and compare the results. Yes, they are identical.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>life.lua: the game of life</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>i386</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>another example taken directly from the Lua distribution, this time
the well known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">game of life</a>.
Start it and enjoy. Only included on i386 by default because it's faster on i386, but it can run on other
platform too (although it requires quite a bit of memory, which is not a problem for boards with external
memory). </p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>morse.lua: because PWM is great, part II</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong> EK-LM3S8962, EK-LM3S6965, SAM7-EX256</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>this uses the same PWM module for Morse code generation. Just enter a
text, and listen to it getting Morsed on your board's speaker and on a blinking Led. The
letters and Morse codes are also shown on the terminal. Use '+' and
'-'' to change the frequency, up and down arrows to change the speed,
's' to mute/unmute, and ESC to exit.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>lhttpd.lua: only with (e)Lua ...</h3>
<p><strong>Runs on: </strong>EK-LM3S8962, EK-LM3S6965</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>this is one of those things that can show the real potential of a
language (and hopefully the real potential of <b>eLua</b> in this case). As
you have probably guessed by now, it's a web server&nbsp;written in Lua.
Except that it is much more than this: it's a <b>scripting web server!</b> That's
right, you can embed parts of Lua code into your pages, and the server
will parse them and replace the Lua code with its output. To output
something from Lua code embedded in a web page, simply use "print" in
your Lua code. You can also write your pages completely in Lua (again,
using "print"), the server knows how to handle this too. When is the
last time you heard about a scripting web server in 256k of Flash/64k
of RAM?&nbsp;</p><p>The full list of features is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>completely written&nbsp;in Lua</li>
<li>can handle a single connection at a time (for now)</li>
<li>can serve text and images (so far)</li>
<li>gets its files from the ROM file system (this will be extended when more
 filesystems are added)</li>
<li>can execute embedded Lua code and replace it with its output (via "print" statements). Embed Lua
 code in your HTML files between tags, make sure
your HTML file extension is ".pht", and the server will preprocess it
and replace the Lua code with its output</li>
<li>if a file with ".lua" extension is requested, it doesn't send the file, but
 executes it and sends its output (via "print" statements)</li>
<p>This is still work in progress, but it already works quite well.
Take a look at <i>romfs/index.pht</i> and <i>romfs/test.lua</i> from the source
distribution for an example of how to include Lua code in your HTML
files.</p>
