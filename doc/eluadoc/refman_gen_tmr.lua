  -- Overview
  overview = [[This module contains functions for accessing the hardware timers of the eLua CPU. In addition, if virtual timers are enabled 
  (see @arch_platform_timers.html#virtual_timers@here@ and @building.html@here@ for details), they can be used just like the "regular" (hardware)
  timers with a single exception: you can't set the clock of a virtual timer (using @#tmr.setclock@tmr.setclock@). To use virtual timers with this
  module, specify $tmr.VIRTx$ as the timer ID instead of a number. For example, if the eLua image was configured to support 4 virtual timers, they will
  be available by using $tmr.VIRT0$ to $tmr.VIRT3$ as timer IDs. The @arch_platform_timers.html#the_system_timer@system timer@ can also be used with
  any of these functions by ommiting the timer ID or specifying it as $tmr.SYS_TIMER$.</p>
  <p>All "time units" (delays, differences in time) in this module, as well as in other parts of eLua (timeouts) are expressed in microseconds. However,
  please keep in mind that the actual timer resolution depends on many factors. For example, it's very likely that the @#tmr.delay@tmr.delay@ function won't
  be able to delay for the exact amount you specify (in us), as the real delay depends on a number of variables, most notably the base clock of the timer 
  and the size of the timer counter register (32 bits on some platforms, 16 bits on most platforms, other values are less common). To ensure that the delay 
  you're requesting is achievable, use @#tmr.getmindelay@tmr.getmindelay@ and @#tmr.getmaxdelay@tmr.getmaxdelay@ to obtain the maximum and the minimum 
  achievable wait times on your timer, respectively. Even if your delay is within these limits, the $precision$ of this function still varies a lot, 
  mainly as a function of the timer base clock. Using the @arch_platform_timers.html#the_system_timer@system timer@ is highly encouraged if it is
  available on the platform as it can eliminate the forementioned problems.]],
