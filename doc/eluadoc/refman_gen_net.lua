  -- Overview
  overview = [[This module contains functions for accessing a TCP/IP network from eLua. It can be enabled only if networking support is also enabled
  (see @building.html@building@ for details).</p>
  <p><span class="warning">NOTE:</span> TCP/IP support is $experimental$ in eLua. While functional, it's still slow and suffers from a number of
  other issues. It will most likely change a lot in the future, so expect major changes to this module as well.</p>
  <p><span class="warning">NOTE:</span> currently, only TCP sockets are supported by eLua.]],
