      desc = 
  [[$Virtual timers$ were added to eLua to overcome some limitations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>there are generally few hardware timers available, some of which might be dedicated (thus not usable directly by eLua).</li>
    <li>many times it is difficult to share a hardware timer between different parts of an application because of conflicting requirements. Generally it's not possible to have timers that can
        achieve long delays and high accuracy at the same time (this is especially true for systems that have 16 bit or even smaller timers).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this respect, $virtual timers$ are a set of timers that share a single hardware timer. It is possible, in this way, to have a hardware timer that can implement 4, 8 or more virtual/software
  timers. There are a few drawbacks to this approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the hardware timer used to implement the virtual timers must generally be dedicated. In fact it can still be used in "read only mode", which means that the only operations that can
        be executed on it are $PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_READ$, $PLATFORM_TIMER_GET_CLOCK$, $PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_MAX_DELAY$ and $PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_MIN_DELAY$. However,
        since the "read only mode" is not enforced by the code, it is advisable to treat this timer as a dedicated resource and thus make it invisible to eLua by not associating it with 
        an ID.</li>
    <li>the number of virtual timers and their base frequency are fixed at compile time.</li>
    <li>virtual timers are generally used for large delays with low accuracy, since their base frequency should be fairly low (see below).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To $enable$ virtual timers:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>edit $platform_conf.h$ (see @arch_overview.html#platforms@here@ for details) and set $VTMR_NUM_TIMERS$ to the number of desired virtual timers and 
       $VTMR_FREQ_HZ$ to the base frequency of the virtual timers (in hertz). For example:
  ~#define VTMR_NUM_TIMERS       4 // we need 4 virtual timers
#define VTMR_FREQ_HZ          4 // the base clock for the virtual timers is 4Hz~</li>
    <li>in your platform port setup a hardware timer to fire an interrupt at $VTMR_FREQ_HZ$ and call the $cmn_virtual_timer_cb$ function (defined in %src/common.c%) in the 
       timer interrupt handler. For example, if the the interrupt handler is called $timer_int_handler$, do this:
  ~void timer_int_handler( void )
{
  // add code to clear the timer interrupt flag here if needed
  cmn_virtual_timer_cb();
}~</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note that because of step 2 above you are limited by practical constraints on the value of $VTMR_FREQ_HZ$. If set too high, the timer interrupt will fire too often, thus taking too much
  CPU time. The maximum value depends largely on the hardware and the desired behaviour of the virtual timers, but in practice values larger than 10 might visibly change the behaviour of your 
  system.</p>
  <p>To $use$ a virtual timer, identify it with the constant $VTMR_FIRST_ID$ (defined in %inc/common.h%) plus an offset. For example, $VTMR_FIRST_ID+0$ (or simply
  $VTMR_FIRST_ID$) is the ID of the first virtual timer in the system, and $VTMR_FIRST_ID+2$ is the ID of the third virtual timer in the system.</p>
  <p>Virtual timers are capable of generating timer match interrupts just like regular timers, check @#platform_timer_set_match_int@here@ for details.

    { title = "The system timer",
    desc = 
  [[The system timer was introduced in eLua 0.9 as a simpler alternative to the traditional eLua timers. Working with regular timers in eLua might be challenging for a number of reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>depending on the hardware, the timers might have a limited range. Because of this, they might not be able to timeout in the interval requested by the user.</li>
    <li>the timers might have different ranges even on the same platform (they might have a different base clock, for example). The problem is further aggravated when switching platforms.</li>
    <li>the timers might be shared with other hardware resources (for example PWMs or ADC triggers) so using them might have unexpected side effects.</li>
    <li>manual timer management is error prone. The user needs to keep into account the timers he's using, their base frequencies and wether they are shared or not with the C code.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The ^#virtual_timers^virtual timers^ can fix some of the above problems, but their resolution is fairly low and they still require manual management.</p>
  <p>The $system timer$ attemps to fix (at least partially) these issues. It is a timer with fixed resolution (1us) %on all platforms% and large counters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if eLua is compiled in floating point mode (default) the counter is 52 bits wide. It will overflow after more than 142 %years%.</li>
    <li>if eLua is compiled in 32 bit integer-only mode (lualong) the counter is 32 bits wide. It will overflow after about one hour.</li>
    <li>if eLua is compiled in 64 bit integer-only mode (lualonglong, new in 0.9) the counter is again 52 bits wide and it will also overflow after more than 142 years.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The eLua API was partially modified to take full advantage of this new timer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>all the functions that can operate with a timeout (for example @refman_gen_uart.html#uart.read@uart.read@ or @refman_gen_net.html#net.accept@net.accept@) 
will default to the system timer is a timer ID is not specified explicitly.</li>
    <li>all the function in the @refman_gen_tmr.html@timer module@ will default to the system timer if a timer ID is not specified explicitly.</li>
    <li>timeouts are specified in a more unified manner across the eLua modules as a $[timeout], [timer_id]$ pair:
  <table class="table_center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>timeout</th>
    <th>timer_id</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>not specified</td>
    <td>any value</td>
    <td>infinite timeout (the function blocks until it completes).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>any value</td>
    <td>no timeout (the function returns immediately).<//td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a positive value</td>
    <td>not specified</td>
    <td>the system timer will be used to measure the function's timeout.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>a positive value</td>
    <td>a timer ID</td>
    <td>the specified timer will be used to measure the function's timeout.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  </li>  
  </ul>
  <p>Using the system timer as much as possible is also encouraged with C code that uses the eLua C api, not only with Lua programs. The C code can use the system timer by specifying 
$PLATFORM_TIMER_SYS_ID$ as the timer ID.</p>
  <p>From an implementation stand point, the system timer is built around a hardware timer with a base clock of at least 1MHz that can generate an interrupt when the timer counter overflows
or when it reaches a certain value. The interrupt handler updates the upper part of the system timer counter (basically an overflow counter). eLua has a generic mechanism that can be used
to implement a system timer on any platform using this method. To take advantage of this mechanism follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>define the $PLATFORM_HAS_SYSTIMER$ macro in your %platform_conf.h% file.</li>
  <li>implement @#platform_timer_sys_raw_read@platform_timer_sys_raw_read@, @#platform_timer_sys_enable_int@platform_timer_sys_enable_int@ and @#platform_timer_sys_disable_int@platform_timer_sys_disable_int@.</li>
  <li>include the %common.h% header.</li>
  <li>setup your hardware timer and its associated interrupt. This should happen an initialization time (for example in %platform_init%).</li>
  <li>call %cmn_systimer_set_base_freq% with the base frequency of your timer in Hz.</li>
  <li>call %cmn_systimer_set_interrupt_freq% with the frequency of the timer's overflow/match interrupt in Hz. Alternatively you can call %cmn_systimer_set_interrupt_period_us% to set the timer's overflow/match
interrupt %period% (in microseconds) instead of its frequency. Use the latter form if the frequency is not an integer.</li>
  <li>call %cmn_systimer_periodic% from your timer's overflow interrupt handler.</li>
  <li>use this implementation for @#platform_timer_read_sys@platform_timer_read_sys@:
 ~timer_data_type platform_timer_read_sys()
{
  return cmn_systimer_get();
}~</li></ol>
  <p>Note that the above mechanism is optional. A platform might have a different method to implement the system timer; this is OK as long as the system timer requirements are respected.</p>
  <p><span class="warning">IMPORTANT NOTE</span>: although system timer support in eLua is optional, implementing the system timer is highly recommended. As already specified, all the timer IDs
in various eLua modules default to the system timer. This means that any code that was written under the assumption that a system timer is present (which is a fair assumption) will fail on 
platforms that don't actually have a system timer. Check @status.html#systmr@here@ for a list of platforms that implement the system timer. If your platform doesn't implement the
system timer, you'll get this warning at compile time:</p>
 ~#warning This platform does not have a system timer. Your eLua image might not work as expected.~
