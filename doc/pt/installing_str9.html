<h3>Installing <b>eLua</b> on the STR9 CPU family from ST</h3>
 <p>Among the ARM based MCUs available today, the <a href="http://www.st.com/mcu/inchtml-pages-str9.html">STR9</a> CPUs from <a href="http://www.st.com">ST</a> stand up because of a few unique features.
 First, their core is an ARM966-E, as opposed to the very popular ARM7TDMI core. This, together with some cleverly chosen on-chip hardware blocks, allows the CPU to run at 96MHz, which is very fast for a 
 general purpose MCU. The particular CPU I'm using (STR912FAW44) ) also has 512k of flash (and another bank of 32k flash) and 96k of internal RAM, so you won't be running out of memory anytime soon. It is accompanied by a very good support library, 
 and ST provides a lot of nice tools for STR9, including a graphical tool that you can use to configure the chip exactly how you want. When I wrote to ST about <b>eLua</b>, they
 agreed to send me a <a href="http://www.hitex.com/str9-comstick/">STR9-comStick</a> board to run <b>eLua</b> on it. Thank you very much for your help, once again. This is the board that I'm going to
 use through this tutorial.</p>
 <h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
 <p>Before you'll be able to use <b>eLua</b> on the STR912FAW44 CPU, make sure that:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>you're using Linux, Windows, or any other OS that has support for <a href="http://openocd.berlios.de/web/">OpenOCD</a>. You might have a look at my <a href="tut_openocd.html">OpenOCD tutorial</a> before continuing.</li>
 <li>if you're on Windows, you have installed the STR9-comStick support package from the accompanying CD.</li>
 <li>you already have your <b>eLua</b> image for the STR912FAW44 CPU (<a href="building.html">built</a> or <a href="downloads.html">downloaded</a>).</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Burning <b>eLua</b> to the STR9-comStick</h3>
 <p>You need OpenOCD to do this. Just follow the instructions from my <a href="tut_openocd.html">OpenOCD tutorial </a>. On the tutorial page you'll also find links to the OpenOCD
 configuration files that I'm using for burning <b>eLua</b> to the comstick.</p>
 <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: for some very strage reasons (probably related to the on-board USB to JTAG converter) my comstick does NOT start to execute the code from its internal flash after being
 powered up via the USB cable (faulty reset sequence?). To overcome this, you'll find a special OpenOCD configuration file on my <a href="tut_openocd.html">OpenOCD tutorial</a> page. It is called <i>comrst.cfg</i>,
 and you can use it to reset your comstick after it is powered up.</p>
 <p>That's it! <b>eLua</b> is now programmed in the CPU, so you can start your terminal emulator and enjoy it, as described in <a href="using.html">using eLua</a>.
