10.09.2008 Bogdan Marinescu <bogdanm@users.berlios.de>

  * Minor release 0.4.1; its main purpose is to integrate the new Lua 5.1.4
  * Changed the file system structure; now you can build both Lua versions
    (floating point and int only) from the same directory
  * Made the math library configurable using the existent 'platform libraries'
    mechanism
  * The "os" and "package" modules are no longer loaded by Lua, since they can't

  * Official release 0.4
  * Added support for LPC2888 (preliminary)
  * Added PWM module
  * New samples: TV-B-Gone (shut off your TV), piano (play piano from your PC
    keyboard), pwmled (fade led on/off), all based on the new PWM module
  * Added support for multiple memory spaces (this can be used to
    take advantage of both the internal CPU RAM and external RAM chips
    on board that have external RAM)
  * Autorun: if "autorun.lua" is found in the filesystem, it is executed
    before starting the shell
  * Added "pack" (binary data packing/unpacking) and "bit" (binary operatinos) 
    modules
  * Build system updated, easier to use, now it knows how to handle "boards" 
    as well as CPUs
  * Modified the existing platform modules to take less RAM and to report an
    error when an unavailable resource is requested
  * Project documentation updated
